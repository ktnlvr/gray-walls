title: Load & Inventory Management
---

Before setting on an adventure you pick your character's _load_, it represents how many items they are willing to carry with themselves. During the game the character may manifest any amount of items up to their _load_, as if they've always had them. Like [Flashbacks](../flashbacks).

_Light_ load allows 3 items. _Medium_ load allows 5, but might raise suspicions upon closer inspection. _Heavy_ allows 6 and will make being stealthy harder.

Some items have a limited amount of _uses_. Every time the item is applied for its direct purpose the use counter ticks down. When it reaches 0 the item is not functional and can not be used.
