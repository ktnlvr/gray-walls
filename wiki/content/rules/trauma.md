title: Trauma
---

When your characters endure damage it impacts their ability to change the world around them. They add up over time, combining into tiers.

- under 2 is _no tier_, you're alright.
- 2 is **Tier 1**. You are clearly worn and been through a lot. No mechanical change, but the trauma is visible.
- 4 is **Tier 2**. You are tired and damaged. Gain _1 Bane_ to all checks.
- 5 is **Tier 3**. You are on the edge.
- Anything over is, well, [Death (or Retirement)](../death-and-retirement).

When their body is injured, a character gains _Physical Trauma_. It can be healed using a [Clock](../clocks) matching the trauma Tier.

```center
[Clock Sections] = 4 + (2 * Trauma Tier)
```

When a characterâ€™s mind is assaulted, they gain _Mental Trauma_. This trauma can only be healed once its root cause is addressed, and recovery often slow and uncertain.
