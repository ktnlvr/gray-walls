title: Flashbacks
---

_Flashbacks_ is the way of retconning the game. When you want something to have happened in the past but it wasn't done in the moment, you may call for a _flashback_.

Describe what you want to have happened and the Keeper will assign it a cost in [Stress](../stress). If you accept, the past is changed and you may move on.

The flashback may not change anything that has already happened. It may only be performed before the dice for resolving the relevant outcome are rolled.
