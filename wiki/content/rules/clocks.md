Clocks track progress on specific activities, they represent how much effort remains until a _consequence_ is resolved. A clock may be introduced for any action that is executed over time.

When something pushing the specified action closer to completion, the next segment is colored in. Once the clock is fully filled in the consequence is resolved.
