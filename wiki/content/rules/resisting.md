title: Resisting
---

When resolving a consequence the player may say "I resist that" to avoid the something entirely. Chose how you'll resist the consequence and roll the _dice pool_ of the respective _attribute_. The problem is avoided, but you gain stress:

```center
[Stress Gained] = 6 - (Highest Dice in the Dice Pool)
```
