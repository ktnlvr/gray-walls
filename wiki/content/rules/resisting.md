title: Resisting

When resolving a consequence the player may say "I resist that" to avoid the something entirely. Chose how you'll resist the consequence and roll the _dice pool_ of the respective _attribute_. The problem is avoided, but you gain stress:

$ #text[Stress Gained] = 6 - (#text[Highest Dice in the Dice Pool]) $
