title: Qualities and Attributes
---

Your _qualities_ are the mechanical advantage of you over everyone else in the scene. They are split into 3 _attributes_: _The Mind_, _The Body_ and _The Spirit_.

The value of an _attribute_ is equal to the amount of first pips taken in its qualities. It represents how well that part of your character is able to resist an external influence.

Each can have up to 4 pips in an _quality_ and up to 3 in _attribute_.

The value of individual _qualities_ within each attribute corresponds to the ability of a character to execute a certain action.
