Every flame must, in time, fade. When the character goes past their [Trauma Tier](../trauma) their chapter is about toi end. At that moment the player has a choice:

- Accept a **legendary sacrifice**. To have one last chance at life, the character may sacrifice something important to them. It may be a plot setback to their arc, a threat to the entire crew, an adversary gaining the upper hand or something else. In that case the character is considered unconcious, but their Trauma is reset to **Tier 3**. They will have to face the consequences when they wake up.
- Perform a **last breathe**. They chose an action to perform that is considered an _automatic complete success_. After that their journey ends. Only the echo lingers.

In practice, the character is either out of action or burried. The players may decide how to proceed with that on their own.
