title: Spells, Rituals and Casting

When casting a spell chose a _Power Level_. Gain that much stress and roll that many dice. Depending on the spell its effect might depend on `[HIGH]` (the highest dice rolled), `[DICE]` (the amount of dice rolled above 3), both or neither!

If you roll _doubles_, something bad happens. If you roll _triples_, something _very bad_ happens. The specifics might be dependent on a spell or the school of magic.
