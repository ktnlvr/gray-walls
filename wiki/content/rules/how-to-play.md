## Preparing

Start by making a character. Make someone up. Make them cool. Get yourselves excited.

### Weirdness

Your characters can get as weird as you desire.

A man with a face of squid? An owner of a peculiar fern? A now aristocrat born into poverty, risen to power selling origami dragons?

Being _weird_ is fun. People don't live long, make them count.

## During a Session

Every session is a loop.

1. **Observe** the environment described by the Keeper.
2. **Decide** what the characters will do.
3. **Roll** to resolve the uncertainties.
4. **Narrate** the results of the actions.
5. **Repeat** and continue the game.

Before the session take some time to remember what happened last time. Revise the maps and the locations. Remember what is at risk.

### Role Playing

You are in control and are acting out the role of your character. You can talk in first or third person. You don't have to dress up as them or figure out an accent, but that certainly won't hurt.

### Best Practices

If you feel lost while playing refer to these guidelines:

- **Ask away**. The world is weird, get to know it.
- **Take notes**. Keep track of the world around you.
- **Work together**. You are more powerful as a team.
- **Make allies**. Friendships never hurt.
- **Combat is war**. Don't be afraid to fight dirty.

### Dice

> For more details refer to [Rolling](/rules/rolling). In general, there is a more detailed version of rules for everything.

A lot of the outcomes are resolved with dice. You roll the specified amount, take lowest if things are bad, take highest when things are good.

### Boons and Banes

Everything around you can help you or harm you. When rolling dice consider Boons and Banes. Both make you roll more dice. Boons make you take the highest. Banes force you to take the lowest. They cancel out.
