title: "Rolling"
---

You roll dice to resolve uncertain outcomes. The _dice pool_ is all the dice that you will be rolling. You always roll at least one dice.

```center
Dice Pool = 1 + (difference between Boons and Banes)
```

When you have more Boons than Banes, you take the highest. When you have more Banes than Boons, you take the lowest.

Values 1, 2 and 3 are _complete failures_. The action does not go through and you are in trouble.

Values 4 and 5 are _partial successes_. What you wanted to do happens, but with a nasty consequence.

A 6 is always a _complete success_, you avoid everything unwanted. For now.
