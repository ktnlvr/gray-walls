title: Rolling
---

You roll dice to resolve uncertain outcomes. The _dice pool_ is all the dice that you will be rolling. You always roll at least one dice. The specific amount of dice is influences by _Boons_ and _Banes_.

_Boons_ can come from different places. Usually it will be the character's [Qualities](../qualities), but it can also be _Help_ (see [Teamwork](../teamwork)) or the environment.

Similarly, _Banes_ will usually be defined by the environment: dim lighting, an opposing force, high guard alertness and so on.

Dice Pool = 1 + (difference between Boons and Banes)
```

When you have more Boons than Banes, you take the highest. When you have more _Banes_ than _Boons_, you take the lowest. When _Boons_ and _Banes_ cancel out, you roll just take the one dice.

- Values 1, 2 and 3 are _complete failures_. The action does not go through and you are in trouble.
- Values 4 and 5 are _partial successes_. Your intention goes through, but with a nasty consequence.
- A 6 is always a _complete success_, you avoid everything unwanted. For now.

Importantly, a _complete success_ does not guarantee that the playerâ€™s intended outcome occurs. Rather, it results in the most favorable _possible_ outcome!
