title: Rolling
---

You roll dice to resolve uncertain outcomes. The _dice pool_ is all the dice that you will be rolling. You always roll at least one dice.

```center
Dice Pool = 1 + (difference between Boons and Banes)
```

When you have more Boons than Banes, you take the highest. When you have more Banes than Boons, you take the lowest. When Boons and Banes cancel out, you roll just take the one dice.

- Values 1, 2 and 3 are _complete failures_. The action does not go through and you are in trouble.
- Values 4 and 5 are _partial successes_. Your intention goes through, but with a nasty consequence.
- A 6 is always a _complete success_, you avoid everything unwanted. For now.

In turn, _Boons_ can come from different places.

In contrast, _Banes_ will usually be defined by the environment: dim lighting, an opposing force, high guard alertness and so on.
